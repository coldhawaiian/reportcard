","body":"ReportCard\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThis is a Report Card widget for tracking your online coding school progress. \r\n\r\nI started this project after posting about a pretty simple widget I had been working on back when Treehouse only had a facebook group as a forum, to see if anyone else had thought about embedding their \"Report Card\" on their personal site. Since there seemed to be some stellar interest, I have been working on this current version of the Report Card Widget as a side project for a number of months now. It has finally come together pretty well, and I am excited to announce version 1.0 of the Coding Report Card!\r\n\r\nA full walkthrough of the installation of this report card widget can be found at http://reportcard.rileyh.com/instructions.html","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
