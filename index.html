<p>This is a Report Card widget for tracking your online coding school progress. </p>

<p>I started this project after posting about a pretty simple widget I had been working on back when Treehouse only had a facebook group as a forum, to see if anyone else had thought about embedding their "Report Card" on their personal site. Since there seemed to be some stellar interest, I have been working on this current version of the Report Card Widget as a side project for a number of months now. It has finally come together pretty well, and I am excited to announce version 1.0 of the Coding Report Card!</p>

<p>A full walkthrough of the installation of this report card widget can be found at <a href="http://reportcard.rileyh.com/instructions.html">http://reportcard.rileyh.com/instructions.html</a></p>
